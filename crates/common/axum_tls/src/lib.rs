//! A crate to handle creating secured [axum] servers with sensible, consistent defaults for thin-edge.
//!
//! # Introduction
//! Thin-edge has a number of requirements in order to maximise the value of HTTPS services
//! it executes, for instance:
//!
//! - Services should use **HTTP by default**, as this makes it easy to get thin-edge up and running
//! - Customers should have **the option to enable HTTPS**, which allows clients to trust they are connecting
//! to the intended host, as well as encrypting any sensitive communication that may occur between
//! the two
//! - Customers should have **the option to enable authentication**, which allows servers to decide whether a
//! client is trusted before granting them access to potentially sensitive information
//!
//! Additionally, when enabling HTTPS, clients shouldn't need to establish whether the server
//! is HTTPS enabled or not (e.g. if I visit <http://google.com> in my browser, it redirects me to
//! <https://google.com>). Similarly, if I try to upload or download via HTTP when I have enabled
//! HTTPS for the file transfer service, the request should succeed (assuming the client in question
//! trusts the server certificate). This limits the pain associated with migrating from HTTP to
//! HTTPS, as the components connecting to thin-edge services don't need to know whether HTTPS is
//! enabled or not, just the server.
//!
//! # Authentication
//! Authentication for thin-edge HTTP services is handled using certificate-based authentication,
//! the same mechanism as what is used to authenticate an MQTT connection to Cumulocity.
