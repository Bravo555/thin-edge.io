*** Test Cases ***
Software list should be populated during startup
    Device Should Have Installed Software    tedge    timeout=120

Install software via Cumulocity

tedge-agent should terminate on SIGINT while downloading file
    [Documentation]    The test uses a custom local http server with throttling applied to it to ensure
    ...                the download does not complete before stopping the tedge-agent

    # wait for the download to start by waiting for a specific marker to appear in the logs
    Logs Should Contain    text=download::download: Downloading file from url    date_from=${start_time}
    Operation Should Not Be PENDING          ${OPERATION}

    # Service should stop within 5s
    Stop tedge-agent

Software list should only show currently installed software and not candidates
